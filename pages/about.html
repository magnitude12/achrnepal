                <h1>ABOUT OUR ORGANISATION</h1>
                <p>Anti Corruption and Human Rights ACHR NEPAL is such an organization, which is selflessly working to eradicate corruption for society, the state, and the country.</p><br><br>
                <p><b>Corruption in Nepal</b><br><br>Corruption is today a worldwide phenomenon. In our own country some people in high positions have been charged for it
                    
                    The selection includes the government official dealing in essential commodities. They found their post-war conditions ideal for fishing in troubled water and getting richer. They formed assort of vicious circle in which moral values and honest intention on longer held value. The flourishing black market in essential commodities, adulteration of even baby-food, fraud/, bribery and economic, political and administrative manipulations with an eye on running profits as brought untold misery to the people.
                    
                    So one would say the corruption in Nepal has an ancient linage, it is scarified by tradition. The author of the Arthasastra made some remark on government officials of his time which are relevant even today; just as it is impossible not to taste the honey or the poison that finds itself at the tip tongue” so it is impossible for a government servant not to eat up at last a bit of the kings, revenue. These in the post-war world become only bolder while eating up government money and accept bribes directly and indirectly. </p>

                <p><b>Human Rights in Nepal</b><br><br><br>
                    
                    After World war2nd (1939 to1945), the term” Human Rights” began to be used. Human Rights refer” to a wide variety of values and capabilities reflecting the diversity of human circumstances and history”. Civil and political Rights are the result of the result of the age of Enlightenment and English, American and French revolutions. The right to life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness, and the right to freedom of speech and worship are guaranteed in democratic constitution of many nations. Economic, social and cultural rights, the rights to an education are also aimed at in many nations’ constitutions.

                    Universal Declaration of human rights was proclaimed by the united Nation organization (UNO) in 1948. Many treaties and agreements for the protection of Human Rights were finalized by the UNO. Later, in the 20th century, “ad hoc international criminal Tribunals” were convened to prosecute serious human rights violations and other crimes in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, Africa.
                    The International Criminal Court was established in 2002 and it is empowered to procedure crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide and war crimes of genocide and war crimes. It is the normal duty of every citizen all over the world, to safeguard God given rights and freedom and to bless the posterity with the world free from corruption of all sorts. </p>
